## 🧠 Project Summary

DLEVS reduces dependency on physical sensors by using historical multivariate time-series data to predict current water quality parameters. It employs several deep learning architectures, including:

- LSTM
- GRU
- BiLSTM
- BiGRU
- CNN-LSTM hybrids

These models are evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R² to assess prediction accuracy.

## 📊 Datasets

Included datasets:

- `WBG_ADAK.csv`, `data_adak.csv`: Sensor data from ADAK site
- `WBG_MAC.csv`, `data_mac.csv`: Sensor data from MAC site

Please refer to the `data/` folder for more details.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rasheedhaq/DLEVS.git
cd DLEVS
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run experiments using Jupyter notebooks

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open any notebook under the `notebooks/` folder to train and evaluate models:
- `All_Models_Order2.ipynb`
- `Wiess_ADAK.ipynb`
- `Wiess_MAC.ipynb`

---

## 📈 Results

Performance is assessed using:
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² Score

Each model’s output and plots are embedded in the respective notebooks.
